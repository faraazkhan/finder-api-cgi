        <PublicOptionName>Coverage for Young Adults Under Age 26</PublicOptionName>
        <PublicOptionDescription>If your parent?s insurance offers dependent coverage, you may be eligible to be covered on their policy until age 26.</PublicOptionDescription>
        <PublicOptionURL>http://cciio.cms.gov/programs/marketreforms/youngadults/index.html</PublicOptionURL>
        <PublicOptionContent>[P] Until now, most young adults "aged off" their parent's health insurance when they turned 19 or graduated from college. Under the Affordable Care Act starting as early as September 2010, if you're covered under your parent's policy, you may be able to remain covered up to age 26. You don't need to live with your parents to be eligible for this coverage. You can also remain covered if you're married. However, before 2014, if you're eligible for health benefits from your own job, your parent's existing job-based policy may not have to cover you. [/P]
[P] Even if you already "aged off" of your parent's policy, you have a chance to rejoin. Starting as early as September 2010, job-based health plans and insurance policies must give young adults who qualify an opportunity to enroll that continues for at least 30 days. Job-based health plans and insurance policies must provide written notice about this special enrollment opportunity. [/P]

        <PublicOptionDescription>You may be eligible for coverage through work - your job or your spouse?s.</PublicOptionDescription>
        <PublicOptionURL>http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/consumer_info_health.html</PublicOptionURL>
        <PublicOptionContent>&lt;p&gt; You and your family may be eligible for health insurance coverage through work at your own job or that of your spouse. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;If your employer offers coverage, you or your family members generally can't be turned away or charged more because of a health condition. This protection is called "nondiscrimination."&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Employers may refuse or restrict coverage for other reasons (such as part-time employment), as long as these are unrelated to your health status and applied consistently.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;If you get job-based coverage, you have &lt;a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/foryou/disabilities/insurance/job/index.html" title="Link to more information on Certain Protections"&gt;certain protections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
