      <h2>HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) </h2>
      <p class="modal-content">
        A type of health insurance that usually limits non-emergency coverage to care from doctors and other providers (such as hospitals or nursing homes) who work for or contract with the HMO. HMOs often offer integrated care and focus on prevention and wellness and coordination of care. You may need to designate a primary care physician and obtain a referral from him or her to see a specialist.

        HMOs generally won't cover out-of-network care except in an emergency. An HMO will generally require you to live or work in its service area to be eligible for coverage.
