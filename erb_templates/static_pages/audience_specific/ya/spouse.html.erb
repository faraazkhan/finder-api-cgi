<p>If you and your spouse are eligible (even if neither of you are enrolled) for job-based health benefits under your spouse's plan, you should be offered a "special enrollment" opportunity to join the plan if you lose other coverage. Your spouse should notify the plan of your loss of coverage and request a special enrollment opportunity. You will have 30 days to join your spouse's job-based health plan.</p>
