<p>If you and your spouse are eligible (even if neither of you are enrolled) for job-based health benefits under your spouse's plan and you lose other coverage, you should be offered a "special enrollment" opportunity to join the plan. Your spouse should notify the plan of your loss of coverage and request a special enrollment opportunity. You will have 30 days to join your spouse's job-based health plan.</p> 
<p>In addition to loss of other coverage, a change in family status, such as marriage, birth or adoption of a child, also gives you the right to a special enrollment opportunity. You will have 30 days to request a special enrollment into your or your spouse's job-based health plan.</p>
